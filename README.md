pyEvilGrade
===========
A quick hack, with very little testing, to implement some basic evilgrade functionality using mitmproxy's inline scripting. Handy for when you want to do other traffic manipulation on unmatched requests at the same time. 

All the modules were converted to python from original [evilgrade](https://github.com/infobyte/evilgrade/), as well all agents and data files coming from there.
